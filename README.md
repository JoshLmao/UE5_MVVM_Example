# UE5 MVVM C++ Example
An example of how to use MVVM (UMG ViewModel plugin) with your UI inside Unreal Engine. Project is build on UE5.4.4

This example heavily relies on using MVVM only via C++, instead of setting in UMG like the plugin intends. It also includes my own code on top to reuse and configure MVVM, on top of Epic's things
